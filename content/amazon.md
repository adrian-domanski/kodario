For this project, I created a small version of **Amazon** using some Stripe magic for payments, and Firebase (cloud functions, storage, and authentication).  
` `  
` `
### Implementation  
` `  
` `
I implemented the following:  
` `  
` `
- Login page - You can use example credentials if you don't want to register.
- Firebase for authentication, storing orders, and cloud functions.
- Stripe payments.  
` `  
` `
### Example credentials  
` `  
` `
- **Login**: test@gmail.com
- **Password**: 123456  
` `  
` `
### Payment Process
` `  
` `
The app is currently in test mode, so you can use the following test card data to pay for your products:  
` `  
` `
- **Card number**: 4242 4242 4242 4242
- **MM/YY**: Any date in the future
- **CVC**: Any 3 digit number
