This case study describes a website project aimed at helping users **find suitable accommodation**. My task was to create the visual layer (front-end) of the website, while the website's mechanics and functionality were still under development.  
` `  
` `
The website was built using **Next.js**, a popular React framework that provides server-side rendering and automatic code splitting. **Tailwind CSS** was used for styling, providing a utility-first approach to CSS that allowed for quick and easy customization of the website's appearance. **TypeScript** was used to add type safety and improve code quality, making the development process more efficient.  
` `  
` `
The website was designed to be **responsive** using **RWD** techniques, allowing it to adapt to different screen sizes and devices. To enhance the website's visual appeal, **GSAP** was used to create eye-catching animations that capture the attention of users. **Styled Components** were used to improve the website's maintainability and flexibility.  
` `  
` `
In summary, this website project was developed to help users find suitable accommodation, with **my task being to create the front-end layer**. The website was built using a variety of cutting-edge technologies, including Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, RWD, GSAP, and Styled Components, resulting in a visually appealing and functional website that meets the needs of users.
