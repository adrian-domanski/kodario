For this website project, our team was tasked with creating an online presence for a **local bakery** that specializes in **custom occasion cakes**. The goal was to provide basic information about the bakery, including their location and contact details, as well as showcase examples of their work.  
` `  
` `
To achieve this, we decided to use **WordPress (CMS)** as the content management system for the website. This allowed for easy management and updating of content, as well as the ability to add additional features as needed. One such feature was a **contact form**, which we implemented to facilitate communication with potential customers.  
` `  
` `
In order to showcase the bakery's skills and expertise, we included **galleries** of past orders on the website. This gave clients a visual representation of the bakery's offerings, and helped them to envision their own custom cakes. Additionally, we linked the bakery's email address with a Gmail account, allowing for quick and convenient communication with clients.  
` `  
` `
To ensure that the website could be easily shared on various **social media** platforms, we also optimized it for social media. This included adding social media icons and ensuring that the website was mobile-friendly.  
` `  
` `
Overall, the website project was a success. Our team was able to create a functional and **user-friendly** website that effectively showcased the bakery's offerings and expertise. By using WordPress as the CMS, implementing a contact form, and including galleries of past orders, we were able to create a website that met the bakery's needs and exceeded their expectations.
