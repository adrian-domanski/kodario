For my **personal portfolio website**, I utilized several modern technologies to create a visually appealing and user-friendly platform that showcases my skills and professional services.  
` `  
` `
The **technologies** used for this project include React, Gatsby.js, Bulma, Styled components, Contentful (CMS), Netlify, GraphQL, and Adobe XD.  
` `  
` `
**Gatsby.js** allowed me to generate fast and efficient static files that improve the website's performance. **Bulma** and **Styled components** provided me with the necessary CSS tools to create a visually appealing and modern design.  
` `  
` `
The website's content was managed by **Contentful**, which allowed me to easily add new projects and update information on the website without having to touch the code. Additionally, the website is hosted on **Netlify**, which provides me with a reliable and scalable hosting solution.  
` `  
` `
**GraphQL** was used to query data from Contentful and serve it to the front-end.  
` `  
` `
Lastly, I used **Adobe XD** to create wireframes and mockups of the website before building it, ensuring that the final product meets my design specifications.  
` `  
` `
In summary, my personal portfolio website was created using a variety of modern technologies, allowing me to showcase my skills and professional services in an appealing and user-friendly platform. The website is **fast**, **scalable**, and **easily updatable** thanks to the use of Contentful.
