For this project, our team was challenged to create a **school planner**, which is a digital planner designed to help students keep track of their homework, quizzes, tests, and other events. The app also allows students to create class groups, where each student can view upcoming events and deadlines for their class.  
` `  
` `
To achieve this, we utilized several cutting-edge **technologies**, including React, Next.js, Progressive Web App (PWA), SCSS, GraphQL, MongoDB, Node.js, Express.js, WebSockets, JWT, AWS S3, Nodemailer, and Adobe XD.  
` `  
` `
**React** and **Next.js** provided the foundation for the web app, allowing us to create fast and responsive server-rendered applications with ease. **PWA** was implemented to enhance the user experience by providing an app-like experience on mobile devices. **SCSS** was used to create customized styles for the web app, while **GraphQL** and **MongoDB** were used for data management and storage. **Node.js** and **Express.js** were used to build the backend, and **WebSockets** and **JWT** were used for real-time communication and authentication. **AWS S3** was used for storing and serving static assets, while **Nodemailer** was used for sending email notifications. Finally, **Adobe XD** was used for design and prototyping.  
` `  
` `
In summary, our team utilized a variety of cutting-edge technologies to develop this project. The app includes a range of features that make it easy for students to **manage their assignments and deadlines**, and to collaborate with classmates. We believe that our app provides a valuable service to students, and it has the potential to revolutionize the way students approach their academic responsibilities.
