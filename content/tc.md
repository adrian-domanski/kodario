For this project, our team was tasked with developing a **3D house configurator for a client from Germany**, Town Country House Configurator. The main goal of the project was to create an interactive web application that allows users to configure their dream house and visualize it in 3D.  
` `  
` `
To achieve this, we utilized several cutting-edge **technologies**, including React.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Responsive Web Design (RWD), Swiper.js, React-Unity-WebGL, Styled Components, Formik, and Web Sockets.  
` `  
` `
**React.js** provided the foundation for the application, allowing us to create interactive and modular components that are easy to work with. **Tailwind CSS** gave us access to a wide range of pre-built styles that could be easily customized to match the design of the application. **TypeScript** provided type checking and improved code quality, while **RWD** made the application responsive on all devices. **Swiper.js** allowed us to create a smooth slider experience for users, and **Formik** handled form validation.  
` `  
` `
To address the challenge of showcasing the client's houses in 3D, we used **React-Unity-WebGL** to create an interactive 3D model that allows users to customize their house in real-time. Additionally, we utilized **Web Sockets** to implement a real-time salesman panel that allows salesmen to connect with customers and provide them with personalized assistance.  
` `  
` `
To ensure that the application is easy to **navigate**, we implemented a simple and intuitive menu that provides users with quick access to the house selection screen and the customization screen.  
` `  
` `
In summary, our team utilized a variety of cutting-edge technologies to develop a 3D house configurator for a client from Germany. The application provides a seamless user experience, features an interactive 3D model, and allows for easy navigation and customization. We believe that our application provides a unique and valuable service that is sure to be a hit with users **looking to configure their dream house**.
